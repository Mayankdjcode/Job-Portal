# Job-Portal

## Developed a dynamic Job Portal website aimed at connecting job seekers with relevant opportunities and assisting employers in identifying suitable candidates. 
## The platform supports two account types: Candidates and Companies, each tailored to their specific needs. 
## Leveraging PHP for server-side scripting, MySQL for database management, and XAMPP with Apache for local development and server hosting.
## This is one of my college projects I did . A website was to be made individually as DBMS Project. 
## I am also attaching my College Project Report with Screenshots and Working :)
